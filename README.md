# What is this?
PaintTogether is a collaborative painting application where multiple clients can connect to a server and work together. This collaboration is possible because changes made on one user's canvas are reflected on another user's canvas. Clients can change brush color, brush size, undo, redo, or even reset the entire canvas to one color!
